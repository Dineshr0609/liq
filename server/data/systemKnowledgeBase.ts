    id: 'calculations',
    category: 'Calculations',
    title: 'How does the contract fee calculation work?',
    content: `LicenseIQ supports sophisticated contract fee calculations:

**Calculation Methods:**
1. **Percentage-Based:** Rate × Gross Amount
2. **Fixed Fee:** Flat amount per transaction or period
3. **Volume Tiers:** Different rates based on sales volume ranges
4. **Minimum Guarantee:** Ensures minimum payment threshold
5. **Caps:** Maximum payment limit per period

**Advanced Features:**
- **Seasonal Adjustments:** Multipliers for specific time periods (e.g., spring: 1.15)
- **Territory Premiums:** Additional rates for specific regions (e.g., California: +0.50%)
- **Escalation Rates:** Automatic rate increases over time
- **Container Size Discounts:** Volume-based adjustments

**Formula Engine:**
- Uses FormulaNode JSON expression trees
- Supports complex nested calculations
- Handles multiple conditional rules
- Applies rules in priority order

**Calculation Process:**
1. Match sales data to contract rules
2. Identify applicable rules based on product/territory/date
3. Apply volume tiers if configured
4. Calculate seasonal adjustments
5. Add territory premiums
6. Apply minimum guarantee or cap
7. Generate detailed breakdown

**Calculation Output:**
- Line-item details with applied rules
- Subtotals by rule type
- Total contract fee amount
- PDF invoice generation
- Calculation history and audit trail

**Example Calculation:**
Sales: $7,680,000
Base Rate: 6.5%
Volume Tier: 0-5M @ 6.5%
Seasonal: None (1.0)
Territory: None (1.0)

Contract Fee = $7,680,000 × 6.5% × 1.0 × 1.0 = $499,200

The system handles all calculations automatically and provides transparent breakdown for verification.`,
