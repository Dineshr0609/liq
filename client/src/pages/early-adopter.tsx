  const faqs = [
    {
      question: "Is this a beta or pilot product?",
      answer: "No. LicenseIQ is deployed in production environments as a financial execution and control layer. The Early Adopter Program is about partnership and scope, not product maturity. Early adopters receive priority onboarding and influence over roadmap sequencing, but deployments are production-grade from day one."
    },
    {
      question: "What problem does LicenseIQ actually solve for Finance?",
      answer: "LicenseIQ gives Finance end-to-end traceability from a signed contract to ERP journal entries. Specifically, it converts contract clauses into executable financial logic, validates real transaction data against those contracts, calculates accruals and settlements deterministically, and produces audit-ready journal outputs with full lineage. This replaces spreadsheet-driven interpretation with finance-owned execution and proof."
    },
    {
      question: "How is this different from our ERP, pricing tools, or incentive systems?",
      answer: "Most systems handle parts of the process: ERPs book results, pricing tools optimize prices, incentive tools manage payouts. LicenseIQ sits between contracts and the books. It ensures the numbers Finance posts are correct, explainable, and defensible — regardless of which upstream systems you use."
    },
    {
      question: "Do we need to replace any existing systems?",
      answer: "No. LicenseIQ does not replace your ERP, does not set prices or approve deals, and does not require ripping out existing tools. It integrates with your current environment and produces ERP-ready outputs while your ERP remains the system of record."
    },
    {
      question: "What contract flows can we start with?",
      answer: "Early adopters typically start with one or two high-impact flows, such as distributor or reseller rebates, price protection or chargebacks, or licensing and royalties. Additional flows can be added over time using the same execution engine."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does implementation take?",
      answer: "Typical timelines are 4–6 weeks for a focused initial deployment. This depends on contract complexity, data readiness, and number of flows. Implementation ensures Finance signs off on contract logic, data validation, and accrual and settlement outputs before go-live."
    },
    {
      question: "Why is there an implementation fee?",
      answer: "Implementation de-risks the deployment for Finance. It covers contract normalization and rule validation, data mapping and reconciliation, ERP output verification, and a close-cycle dry run. Early adopters may receive discounted or credited implementation fees, but the work itself is essential to ensure trust in the numbers."
    },
    {
      question: "How is pricing determined?",
      answer: "Pricing is based on revenue under management, contract and data complexity, and number of flows in scope. It is not based on number of users, number of documents, or usage/compute. Most early adopters see 5–10× ROI through leakage reduction, close efficiency, and audit risk reduction."
    },
    {
      question: "Is LicenseIQ SOC / audit ready?",
      answer: "LicenseIQ is designed for audit defensibility, including clause-to-journal traceability, reproducible calculations, and clear evidence packages for auditors. Formal certifications can be discussed as part of enterprise rollout planning."
    },
    {
      question: "What does 'early adopter' mean in practice?",
      answer: "Early adopters get priority access to the founding team, influence roadmap sequencing, receive favorable commercial terms, and shape how the category evolves. It is a design partnership, not a trial program."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens after the early adopter phase?",
      answer: "Early adopters retain their pricing protections, expand scope at agreed commercial terms, and transition seamlessly into standard support and governance models. There is no forced re-platforming or re-implementation."
    },
    {
      question: "How do we know if we're a good fit?",
      answer: "You're likely a strong fit if Finance relies on spreadsheets to execute contract-driven revenue, accruals or settlements require explanation every close, audits or disputes create recurring friction, and you want Finance — not Sales Ops — to own financial truth."
